# My Vim Environment

I've been a happy Vimer since 2009, playing and tweaking.

## Plugins

### Decho

### AutoComplPop

Automatically opens popup menu for completions

### mru.vim

Plugin to manage Most Recently Used (MRU) files

### ReloadScript

Reload a VIM script during script development.

## Surround

surround.vim: quoting/parenthesizing made simple

### Matchit

The matchit.vim script allows you to configure % to match more than just single characters.
